    <h1>postions in css</h1>
    <p>position is a property in css which is used to set the position of an element in a webpage. There are 5 types of positions in css.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>static</li>
        <li>relative</li>
        <li>absolute</li>
        <li>fixed</li>
        <li>sticky</li> 
    </ol>
    <p>1.static is the default position of an element in a webpage. It is not affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.</p>
    <p>2.relative is the position of an element relative to its normal position. It is affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.</p>
    <p>3.absolute is the position of an element relative to its parent element. It is affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.</p>
    <p>4.fixed is the position of an element relative to the viewport. It is affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.</p>
    <p>5.sticky is the position of an element relative to its parent element. It is affected by top, bottom, left, right properties.
        ***sticky only moves in parents container in viewport if scrollbar .if container is outside of viewport then it will look for scroll bar in parents if not available then moves according to viewport***
    </p>
    <p>when we use position property in css then we have to use top, bottom, left, right properties to set the position of an element.</p>
    <p>inset is used to give top,right,left,bottom value together</p>

    <h2>Differences between fixed(relative to viewport) and absolute(relative to parent)</h2>


    <b>when position value is other than static, then it is completely disappeared to it's parent
        also  it decreases the original = width - dissappeared element width,even though element is their.
