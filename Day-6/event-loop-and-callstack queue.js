//event loop
//callstack
//queue

//callstack is a data structure that records where in the program we are 
//if we call a function, it is added to the callstack
//if we return from a function, it is removed from the callstack
//callstack is a LIFO data structure
//callstack is a synchronous data structure
//callstack is a blocking data structure
//callstack is a single threaded data structure
//callstack is a stack data structure

//queue is a data structure that records what needs to be done
//queue is a FIFO data structure
//queue is a non-blocking data structure
//queue is a multi-threaded data structure



//event loop is a mechanism that makes sure that the callstack is empty before adding the next event
